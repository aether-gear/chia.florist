// TokenClaims represents the claims extracted from an authentication token.
//
// This type acts as the bridge between the token layer and the application.
// It mirrors the identity and authorization information stored within a
// signed token, such as a JWT, and is primarily used during token
// validation, parsing, generation, and authentication middleware.
//
// TokenClaims should not be passed directly to business use cases.
// Instead, it should be translated into an AuthContext after the token
// has been successfully validated.
